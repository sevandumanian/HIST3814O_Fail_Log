### Week 3 Fail Log
Input the Command line for step 1
The code came out but once I downloaded it and tried to transfer it over, I failed
Attempted to figure out a way to save this and prove that the code works
*NOTE THAT THIS WILL BE SUBMITTED UNDER THE EXTRA WORK PART*
That is my texas.txt download
Could not finish that so moved onto step one of identifying lines
With the RegerX, my work somehow is not being read by the DHBox
Maybe I did the work incorrectly or transfrered it the wrong way
Maybe I did not do enough but because of this failure, I am unable to follow the
sed -r -i.bak 's/(.+\bto\b.+)/~\1/g' texas.txt Command
After I transfered my text back to regex I could not finish the process
Excersice 1 was completed in bits but not fully because of the failure at the early stages
Parts of failure came from mistakes and lack of understanding the RegEXR
Other half came from failure of commands working even though I followed it step by step and watched the youtube video 5 times
Exercise #2
I downloaded the refine and first it would not let me download because of security reasons. When I downloaded it, my computer would not
function normally, my computer was slowed down significantly and it would not fuction properly.
I find it intresting and weird how my computer was slowed down because of not only downloading it but also trying to open it. I think the software
does not work with me Dell Laptop.
Capstone:
I failed to understand how to start of approach this part
