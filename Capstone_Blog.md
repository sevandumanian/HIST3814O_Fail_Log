### Capstone Blog

Chose Option #1 Github Pages with a static site generator
I am following the steps in setting up my github account through the DHbox.
Because I experianced problems with the last section of work, I had to create a new DHbox.
My work is lost. Therefore, following step 11 & 12, my DHbox failed to retrieve refrences.
I believe that this is the case due to the capstone bringing each weeks work together.
