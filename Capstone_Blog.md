### Capstone Blog

Chose Option #1 Github Pages with a static site generator
I am following the steps in setting up my github account through the DHbox.
Because I experianced problems with the last section of work, I had to create a new DHbox.
My work is lost. Therefore, following step 11 & 12, my DHbox failed to retrieve refrences.
I believe that this is the case due to the capstone bringing each weeks work together.
I experianced problems again with the DHbox which has limited me to completing the online exhibit with Omeka.
I can not commit to this exercise because I am not 100% sure if my domain was saved even though everything seems to be working on github/fontexercise
For the typeography, I followed the steps and was able to copy the code and format it according to the font I wanted in Google Fonts.
From there I was able to use my knoledge to follow through on the colour exercise and choose a colour and change the code to colour hex #b3285d.
I feel like my stregnths in this capstone exercise were following the steps to format and structure of the assignment. Following the colour and typeography helped me understand the website design but my faults came from the problem with the dhbox. I feel that this application was my weakness throughout this entire course and hurt me in the last bit of this course. I belive that if you view my dhbox online the steps followed in option 1 will prove that I secured a domain, but I do not know how to access it.
I feel that I slowly understand how to use github and understand the structure of the platform but my knoledge with DHbox is on the fence. As this course progressed, with the feedback I became better at learning how to use this platform and follow through.
