### Module #2

### Reading Analysis
Causer & Wallace, Building A Volunteer Community: Results and Findings from Transcribe Bentham DHQ 6.2, 2012

A community can be refereed to as a crowd, but a crowd can not be refereed to as a community. 
Crowd sourcing argues the gathering of information through a specific demographic. 
This provides ambiguity for a crowd because they are more generalized with their historical data.
Gathering resources comes in two parts
1) Actual resources and archives
2) Technology and public service/work
With growing an army of librarians, your search and marketing must cover all platforms (Ref Annotation)
Labour should be split between online resources and textual resources in the area.
- This creates two platforms
1) Textual is limited but focuses on the bigger picture
2) Online has endless resources (As long as we have people transerfering them online)
This frames knoledge online because of the millions of resources, 
convience, and security of maintaining the resource
The amount of time, energy and employee's involved furthers the world of knoledge
from and acedemic perspective.
Endless resources provides diversity in reading
Under-rated authors get a chace for their work to be read
Different perspectives on topics with counter arguments at the click of a button
Further develops the cirriculum for schools
- This infastructure has developed Carleton University
- All this knoledge is obtainable on each university platform
- Workers have to find the authors book, scan it page by page
- Prevent the copyright strike
- upload it to the Carleton library portal/Uploade to course ARES
- Restrict access for only those students who are taking the course
The development of the infastructure is to set a plotform
that relies on algorithims to navigate the user to various texts
The devlopment of the historian site refrenced by the authors focuses
on the actual historians and their work contributed
Constraints with librarians working and creating a digital archive
- Money
- unable to Untranscribed manuscripts
- Complexity of archives
- Encoding
