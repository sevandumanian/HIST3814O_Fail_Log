### Module #2

### Reading Analysis
Causer & Wallace, Building A Volunteer Community: Results and Findings from Transcribe Bentham DHQ 6.2, 2012

A community can be refereed to as a crowd, but a crowd can not be refereed to as a community. 
Crowd sourcing argues the gathering of information through a specific demographic. 
This provides ambiguity for a crowd because they are more generalized with their historical data.
Gathering resources comes in two parts
1) Actual resources and archives
2) Technology and public service/work
With growing an army of librarians, your search and marketing must cover all platforms (Ref Annotation)
Labour should be split between online resources and textual resources in the area.
- This creates two platforms
1) Textual is limited but focuses on the bigger picture
2) Online has endless resources (As long as we have people transerfering them online)
This frames knoledge online because of the millions of resources, 
convience, and security of maintaining the resource
The amount of time, energy and employee's involved furthers the world of knoledge
from and acedemic perspective.
Endless resources provides diversity in reading
Under-rated authors get a chace for their work to be read
Different perspectives on topics with counter arguments at the click of a button
Further develops the cirriculum for schools
- This infastructure has developed Carleton University
- All this knoledge is obtainable on each university platform
- Workers have to find the authors book, scan it page by page
- Prevent the copyright strike
- upload it to the Carleton library portal/Uploade to course ARES
- Restrict access for only those students who are taking the course
The development of the infastructure is to set a plotform
that relies on algorithims to navigate the user to various texts
The devlopment of the historian site refrenced by the authors focuses
on the actual historians and their work contributed
Constraints with librarians working and creating a digital archive
- Money
- unable to Untranscribed manuscripts
- Complexity of archives
- Encoding

Exercise #1
Using the Epigraphic Database
- Researching history around my culture in Armenia (I am Armenian if my first and last name did not give it away)
- Nothing is found around Armenia
- Very logical knowing the downfall of the genocide in 1915
- A lot of the culture was burned and a lot of historical articacts and archives are forever missing
- Although searching Armenian withing a specific time frame, the site navigates the user to other prominent archives
from the Middle East
- With the CWGC database, I knew before using it that nothing would come up
...and I was right!
The aftermath of the Armenian Genocide had all Armenian's regrouping and creating a new lives for themselves
As Armenian's escaped the genocide, the big part of their new life was their last name and the
symbolizm of being Armenian
For being Armenian, the "ian" at the end of a last name ex. Dumanian, symbolizes that they are Armenian
With the change in lifestyles due to this historical event, many Armenians were not keeping the "ian" in thier last names
This messes with numerous databases and also provides conflict with the whole war system because Armenian were coming into
North American as immigrants
Pre 1915 war was different in Armenian, but no one in my family ever served beyond 1915 for any country.

Datum = Data
*Digitized data is not value-neutral*

- Focusing on a view to create a perspective
