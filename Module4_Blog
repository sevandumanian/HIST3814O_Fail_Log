### Module #4 Reading
Look at the work of Michelle Moravec who is using corpus linguistics tools to understand the history of women's suffrage

Key Questions: who benefits from this? Who is hurt from this?
The term corpus linguistics finds the relationship between words in text. The reading goes onto argue how these machines benifit historians
These machines can not only deal with mass volumes of text but find the relationship as previousilty stated. Although this benifits technology
this hurts humanity as archives gain this technological dependency because the human mind can not store and corelate all that information.
The corpus software creates a dependency that disregrads human power of skimming
This brings up the argument of man vs technology. Technology from a historian perspective is killing the job market and replaces human work.
The tools used in the corpus:
Concordance Tool
Concordance Plot Tool
File View Tool
Clusters (N‚ÄêGrams)
Collocates
Word List
Keyword List

With the word list I see some pros and cons in my opinion:
Pros:
Breaks down the usage of every word
Adds a frequency and ranks each word used in the article
Allows a secondary view that allows you to see all the sentances with the one word
Rating system that shows the probability of the word showing up again in text (Actual unique words)

Cons:
Focuses on every word which does not put emphasis on the historical event
With feminism and Sufferage, Corpus should be breaking down words around that topic and no the "I" "It" "Them" etc.
View should group together the words to find the argument and point that out in the archive

Concluding thoughts are that the technological progression and dependency are benificial to digital archive creation and analysis
but this technology hurts historians and work in my opinion because an infastructure has been developed to eliminate their work.
