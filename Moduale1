### Moduale 1
Firstly, lost my entire fail log throughout the week, I belive I forogt to save it of create a /name.
Whatever the case I am frusterated and will recreated my fail log to the best of my ability
Throughout the week of the first moduale I had to reset my password because I downloaded the github desktop app
and it was not accepting my password before and after the change.
All work will be done on Google Chrome.
Section 1 of Moduale 1 went well except leading up to the coding of pictures. For some reason I have coded them 
correctly yet the image does not come out and it shows this defualt picture which I do not know how to explain
*NOTE THAT PART 1 SHOULD BE IN MY GITHUB*
Section 2 learning how to use the comands on the DH Box was going well until the saving the work and re opening it
The work would save no problem but will not open the work like in the YouTube Video. 
Will send a screenshot to the prof to prove I followed and understand the code operation
*Sreenshots made*
Because of that I failed to finish the last few steps of sections 2
Going at it for about an hour and I feel that it is not working because I do not have the software or something to open the code
FAILURE TO COMPLETE EXERCISE 4!
DH Box & Computer would not let me pull up my past file from exercise 2
Trial and error occured but nothing could be resolved to get past 4.1
Because I could not pull up my past work that is still saved
I could not incouperate the comand $ mkdir first-repo
Because my computer can not read the DH Box work from chrome, I can not get the Git status and merge
Very upset that I can not put all the parts together!
