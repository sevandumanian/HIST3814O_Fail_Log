### Module 4 Fail Log

Exercise #1
Exercise 1 can not be completed I can not understand the process of Network analysis in R
I followed the guilde given on http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/supporting%20materials/quick-intro-r/
I fail to understand the process of R
When I follow the steps, mine does not look like the guide online
Following the steps from 9-12, the number imputs were leading to nothing and I did not know how to fix it

Approaching the DHBox part of this module, I was unable to complete anything because my 1 month trial has expired and I could not use my DHBox anymore. I do not know how to approach module 4 but if their is an alternative, I would like to follow through on whatever comes up.
