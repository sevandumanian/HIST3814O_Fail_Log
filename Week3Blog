*The command:*

Why don't historians discuss this kind of work?
Visual media implies the development of digital archives through another medium. Imagery is used to focus on the bigger picture.
In the video shown by Ian Milligan, the collection of images creates a picture to focus on geography versus individuals. Historians can argue
population density and growth of society. With the imageplot creation, historians can see a visual media repreisantation of area. Comparisons
can be made between population in various years. Historians can raise the argument that population density has increased.

What gets hidden, what gets lost, how is the ultimate argument weaker as a result?
With the use of ImagePlot, the amulgimation of thousands of images provides a generic connotation. Due to the large numbers, imagery and analytics
focus on the bigger picture and each individual gets loss in the census. the ultimate argument becomes weaker because although imagery
is capturing the bigger picture, each archives is being generalizes and that can potentially contridict history and historical events,
The generalization can define history as a whole but hurts each historical event due to the lack of explination.
